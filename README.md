Dataset used: This Dataset examines weathering variations in deglaciated and proglacial watersheds in Greenland to assess the impact of ice sheet retreat on isotopic and nutrient fluxes. It compares stream discharge and water chemistry data from proglacial and nonglacial streams during different melt seasons. The dataset includes measurements of various solutes, isotopes, and organic matter characteristics.

Information about Dataset: It is a point vector data containing includes measurements of various solutes, isotopes, and organic matter characteristic of proglacial and non glacial lakes of Greenland.
